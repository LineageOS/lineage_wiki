      "message": "Is this a lineage rom bug you\u0027re describing here? Is it that way on stock rom?  Or a known hardware issue with the phone, regardless of rom?\nSounds to me like this is just a matter of the port being CTIA standard, not OMTP. Which is pretty normal for smart phones nowadays. Only 3 ring CTIA standard headsets will work, while 3 ring OMTP standard headsets will have issues like mic not working or mic vol very low. Besides, you can buy an adapter to plug OMTP headset into CTIA port.",
