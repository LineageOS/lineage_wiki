      "message": "Huh? What\u0027s wrong about it?\n\nThe usb cable is fine, I was able to use fastboot and adb commands fine EXCEPT sideload. Changing ports or cables didn\u0027t do shit, at least with the ones I have. I\u0027ve seen other users encounter the same problem.\n\nYes, it would have \"bricked\" my phone since I started doings things outside of the guide as workaround. I got locked out of my adb access because I changed my adb version midway and my device was no longer authorized because of that. I couldn\u0027t boot back to normal mode because it just loads indefinitely for some reason.\n\nAlso I didn\u0027t say using sideload bricks the phone, it\u0027s the lack of options besides sideloading that could have bricked it. Realizing I could apply updates from the usb drive saved my pickles. If that was mentioned in the guide in the first place, that would have saved me a lot of trouble and anxiety.\n\n    We absolutely do not intend to have users utilize external storage to flash the zip.\n\nWhat\u0027s the reason for this? At least mention it as a last resort. This just sounds like treating users as a bunch of retards, which to be fair, true in a lot of cases.\n\nBut yeah, if you don\u0027t want to include that in the wiki, fine with me, no skin off my back. I don\u0027t know why you act like the wiki is in pristine condition that is free from flaws. It\u0027s called a wiki for a reason. It\u0027s was already tedious enough to setup a dev environment just for the wiki, and then just to read and decipher through flat nested if-statements in an stringly-typed templating language that builds horribly slow. I would be mad crazy if I would work on this wiki without strong reasons to do so on my own volition. Sorry for the rant, if I sound sore, it\u0027s probably because I am.",
