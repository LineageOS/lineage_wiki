      "message": "Huh? What\u0027s wrong about it?\n\nThe usb cable is fine, I was able to use fastboot and adb commands fine EXCEPT sideload. Changing ports or cables didn\u0027t do shit, at least with the ones I have. I\u0027ve seen other users encounter the same problem.\n\nYes, it would have \"bricked\" my phone since I started doings things outside of the guide as workaround. I got locked out of my adb access because I changed my adb version midway and my device was no longer authorized because of that. I couldn\u0027t boot back to normal mode because it just loads indefinitely for some reason.\n\nAlso I didn\u0027t say using sideload bricks the phone, it\u0027s the lack of options besides sideloading that could have bricked it. Realizing I could apply updates from the usb drive saved my pickles. If that was mentioned in the guide in the first place, that would have saved me a lot of trouble and anxiety.\n\n    We absolutely do not intend to have users utilize external storage to flash the zip.\n\nWhat\u0027s the reason for this? At least mention it as a last resort. This just sounds like treating users as a bunch of retards, which to be fair, true in a lot of cases.\n\nBut yeah, if you don\u0027t want to include that in the wiki, fine with me, no skin off my back. I don\u0027t know why you act like the wiki is in pristine condition that is free from flaws. It\u0027s called a wiki for a reason. It\u0027s was already tedious enough to setup a dev environment just for the wiki, and then just to read and decipher through flat nested if-statements in an stringly-typed templating language that builds horribly slow. I would be mad crazy if I would work on this wiki without strong reasons to do so on my own volition. Sorry for the rant, if I sound sore, it\u0027s probably because I am.",

      "message": "Okay, few things:\n\nWe don\u0027t want users to use external storage for a variety of reasons, many devices don\u0027t properly support OTG, we don\u0027t want to have to maintain a comprehensive list of the ones that do, we don\u0027t want to make a recommendation that doesn\u0027t work for people - and everyone else has ADB side load working to install.\n\nIf it wasn\u0027t working for you it\u0027s not device specific, it is specific to your instance and your machine, and the combination of such. I\u0027m really betting that if you reinstalled your drivers, grab the newest ATV like the guide tells you to, and tried a diff port/cable it would work fine.\n\nWe don\u0027t want to just say \"oh this important thing that you need to be able to do doesn\u0027t work so do a different thing\".\n\nI don\u0027t act at all like this wiki is interesting condition, it needs a ton of work. But at the moment the install instructions work for 99% of people. \n\nAs for wiki development, standing it up locally is definitely a pain, what I would just recommend to you in the future is to push your review patch sets up here, let the bot build them, and then use the bots preview. We set that up so that users would have a better time contributing!",

      "message": "Some of the instructions you recommend here are not included in the wiki, or what\u0027s shown in Pixel 2XL install guide. I have also sucessfully installed lineageOS on other devices before, so I have a pretty good idea what I\u0027m doing. Even then, I still made sure to read and follow the steps carefully and precisely.\n\nFirst off, the guide said nothing about reinstalling drivers, or grabbing the newest ATV (what\u0027s ATV?). Regardless, I\u0027m using linux and I always make sure my system and drivers are always up to date. Perhaps you also meant to say, use the latest android platform tools? In that case, the wiki should also say that. But that doesn\u0027t also work.\n\nMaybe the phone should have the latest available update? Again, the wiki doesn\u0027t mention anything about that. It only says \"Android 11 of stock OS\", so it\u0027s safe to assume that the updating the phone OS is not important. It\u0027s indeed not important since the later steps would cause a fact ory reset to cancel out any updates, so I don\u0027t think this is the update you are referring to. I also just bought the phone unused, I also did a factory reset prior to that.\n\nMore importantly, the thing about ports and cable is only mentioned in the \"Unlocking the bootloader\" step:\n\n\u003e Once the device is in fastboot mode, verify your PC finds it by typing:\n\u003e\n\u003e    ```fastboot devices```\n\u003e\n\u003e If you donâ€™t get any output or an error:\n\u003e - on Windows: make sure the device appears in the device manager without a triangle. Try other drivers until the command above works!\n\u003e - on Linux or macOS: If you see no permissions fastboot try running fastboot as root. When the output is empty, check your USB cable and port!\n\nLike I said before, fastboot and adb works fine for me. The cable is fine, the port is fine. I have encountered cases before where I have an incompatible port and a non-data cable. This is not it. If the cable/port is the problem, either fastboot and adb will not work. I got past this step with flying colors, therefore my cables and ports are working as god intended.\n\nMaybe this is something specific only to me and to my setup? I disagree, I\u0027ve seen other people express this very same problem. I do think this is a problem specifically with Pixel 2XL and with more recent versions of lineageOS.\n\nIf you still insist this is a still a me-problem, that I failed to follow the guide as instructed, then yes, that you are indeed acting like the wiki is flawless. Probably true for other phones, but Pixel 2XL guide is not working, not just for me specifically. You can prove me half-wrong by finding someone to test installation of recent lineageOS on Pixel 2XL.\n\nAt the very least, maybe you can just a special note just for Pixel 2XL?",
