Migrating from draft-06 to draft07

No draft-06 features were changed, although two keywords were renamed for clarity and consistency:

    mediaType -> targetMediaType
    submissionEncType -> submissionMediaType

Additionally, hrefSchema was somewhat confusing, so a great deal more effort has gone into explaining 
how it works, and how it fits into the overall link resolution process.
