This is our shiny new wiki, which uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You can look at the source [on GitHub](https://github.com/LineageOS/lineage_wiki), or
even learn how to [contribute!]({{ "contributing.html" | relative_url }}).

Looking for information about your device? You can look for it on our [devices list]({{ "devices/" | relative_url }}).

Always eager to learn? Here you can find a nice [list of how-tos]({{ "how-tos.html" | relative_url }}).

This wiki is still young, so please bear with us as we transfer information across from the old wiki.

You can view all current pages [here]({{ "pages.html" | relative_url }}).
