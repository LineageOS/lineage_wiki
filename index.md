## For users

### Get LineageOS!

* You can check if your device is on our [list of supported devices]({{ "devices/" | relative_url }}).
* You can look at our information on [requesting a device]({{ "device_requests.html" | relative_url }}).

### Report bugs!

* To grab information needed for a bug report, you can [setup ADB]({{ "adb_fastboot_guide.html#installing-adb-and-fastboot" | relative_url }})
and then [capture a log]({{ "logcat.html" | relative_url}}).
* Then, learn where to report your bug by reading our [how-to on reporting bugs]({{ "bugreport-howto.html" | relative_url }}).

## For everyone

### Contribute to the wiki!

This wiki is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

* You can look at the source [on GitHub](https://github.com/LineageOS/lineage_wiki).
* And of course, we have a comprehensive guide on [contributing]({{ "contributing_wiki.html" | relative_url }}).

### Build for your device!

* Every officially-supported device has a comprehensive set of build instructions. Simply choose your device from our [list of supported devices]({{ "devices/" | relative_url }}) to get started.

### How-tos!

We even have a nice [list of how-tos]({{ "how-tos.html" | relative_url }}), for inquisitive souls.

## For developers

### Contribute!

* To contribute, you'll need to be able to produce builds for your device. Pick your device from our [list of supported devices]({{ "devices/" | relative_url}}) to get started.
* Once you're successfully running your own build, you can begin to make your changes. All the apps included in LineageOS can be found in `packages/apps`, and core parts of the system can be found
in `frameworks/base`.
* Once you've finished making your change, simply follow our guide on [submitting to Gerrit]({{ "submitting-patch-howto.html" | relative_url}}).

### Submit your port!

* If you unofficially maintain a device, and think it's good enough to go live, follow our instructions on [submitting a port]({{ "submitting_device.html" | relative_url }}). One of our developer relations
staff will reach out to you, and we'll work to get the ball rolling on official builds for your device.

### LineageSDK

Enhance your apps with new Lineage-specific APIs using the [LineageOS platform SDK]({{ "sdk" | relative_url}}).
