## For users

### Get Lineage!

* You can check if your device is support on our [list of support devices]({{ "devices/" | relative_url }}).
* You can look at our information on [requesting a device]({{ "device_requests.html" | relative_url }}).

### Report bugs!

* To grab information needed for a bug report, you can [setup ADB]({{ "adb_fastboot_guide.html#installing-adb-and-fastboot" | relative_url }})
and then [capture a log]({{ "http://wiki.lineageos.org/logcat.html" | relative_url}}).
* Then, learn where to report your bug by reading our [how-to on reporting bugs]({{ "bugreport-howto.html" | relative_url }}).

## For everyone

### Contribute to the wiki!

This wiki is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

* You can look at the source [on GitHub](https://github.com/LineageOS/lineage_wiki).
* And of course, we have a comprehensive guide on [contributing!]({{ "contributing.html" | relative_url }})

### Build for your device!

* Every officially-support device has a comprehensive set of build instructions: simply choose your device from our [list of supported devices]({{ "devices/" | relative_url }}) to get started!

### How-tos

We even have a nice [list of how-tos]({{ "how-tos.html" | relative_url }}), for inquisitive souls.

## For developers

### Contribute!

* To contribute, you'll need to be able to produce builds for your device - pick your device from our [list of supported devices]({{ "devices/" | relative_url}}) to get going.
* Once you've gotten a build successfully running, you'll need to make your changes - all the apps included in Lineage can be found in `packages/apps`, and core parts of the system can be found
in `frameworks/base`.
* Once you've finished making your change, simply follow our guide on [submitting to gerrit!]({{ "usinggerrit-howto.html#submitting-to-gerrit" | relative_url}})

### Submit your port!

* If you unofficially maintain a device, and think it's good enough to go live, follow our instructions on [submitting a port]({{ "submitting_device.html" | relative_url }}). One of our developer relations
people will reach out to you, and we'll work to get the ball rolling on official builds for your device!

You can view all current pages [here]({{ "pages.html" | relative_url }}).
