Both of those start building just fine now.\n\nAs that makes at least one buildable arch for each target, I amended the change now to include TV/Car GSIs as well.\n\nFor LineageOS 18, does the GSI/emulator merge apply here as well (i.e. `lineage_{car,tv}_\u003carch\u003e` are both GSI and emulator targets at the same time)?",
