note_title: TWRP recoveries
note_content: The Tab 2 series currently does not have either a working or an up-to-date TWRP recovery for the supported models. As the official TWRP recovery images have problems with them, flashing LineageOS 13.0 and/or Google Apps will fail. Therefore the only way to flash successfully is to use the unified and unofficial TWRP build made by Android-Andi (one of the maintainers of the device) on the XDA-Developers Forums. This recovery works on all supported models.
