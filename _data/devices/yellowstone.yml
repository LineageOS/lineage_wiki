note_content: This device is technically unsupported, as for a variety of reasons it is no longer feasible to backports Android Security Bulletins (ASBs) to Android 9. As such, one final build is published that is based on the December, 2025 security patch level. There will very likely be no further builds for this device.
note_content: LineageOS builds for this device do not support the device's Camera array (Flash, Front/Rear Camera, IR Camera), due to compatibility issues with proprietary components and lack of kernel support. You may be able to return to stock firmware after the installation process, though this is unsupported, and untested. No warranty is implied or provided.
