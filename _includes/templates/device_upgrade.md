Follow your [device's installation guide]({{ "devices/" | append: device.codename | append: "/install" | relative_url }}) to see how you can update your recovery image.{% endcapture %}

The updater app does not support upgrades from one version of LineageOS to another, and will block installation to any update for a different version. Upgrading manually requires similar steps to installing LineageOS for the first time.

{%- if device.maintainers != empty %}
1. Download the [LineageOS install package](https://download.lineageos.org/{{ device.codename }}) that you'd like to install or [build]({{ "devices/" | append: device.codename | append: "/build" | relative_url }}) the package yourself.
{%- else %}
1. [Build]({{ "devices/" | append: device.codename | append: "/build" | relative_url }}) a LineageOS install package.
{%- endif %}
    * Optionally, download an application package add-on such as [Google Apps]({{ "gapps.html" | relative_url }}) (use the `{{ userspace_architecture }}` architecture).
2. Make sure your computer has working `adb`. Setup instructions can be found [here]({{ "adb_fastboot_guide.html" | relative_url }}).
3. Enable [USB debugging]({{ "adb_fastboot_guide.html#setting-up-adb" | relative_url }}) on your device. {{ devOptions }}
4. Run `adb reboot sideload`.

{%- if device.is_ab_device and device.uses_twrp %}
