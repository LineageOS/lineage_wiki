## Manually upgrading LineageOS

{%- unless device.is_ab_device %}
{%- capture recovery_update %}In some cases, a newer LineageOS version may not install due to an outdated recovery.
Follow your [device's installation guide]({{ "devices/" | append: device.codename | append: "/install" | relative_url }}) to see how you can update your recovery image.{% endcapture %}
{% include alerts/tip.html content=recovery_update %}
{%- endunless %}

The updater app does not support upgrades from one version of LineageOS to another, and will block installation to any update for a different version. Upgrading manually requires similar steps to installing LineageOS for the first time.

{% if device.maintainers != empty %}
1. Download the [LineageOS install package](https://download.lineageos.org/{{ device.codename }}) that you'd like to install or [build]({{ "devices/" | append: device.codename | append: "/build" | relative_url }}) the package yourself.
{% else %}
1. [Build]({{ "devices/" | append: device.codename | append: "/build" | relative_url }}) a LineageOS install package.
{% endif %}
    * Optionally, download additional application packages such as [Google Apps]({{ "gapps.html" | relative_url }}) (use the `{{ userspace_architecture }}` architecture).
2. Make sure your computer has working `adb`. Setup instructions can be found [here]({{ "adb_fastboot_guide.html" | relative_url }}).
3. Run `adb reboot sideload`.
4. Run `adb sideload /path/to/zip` (inserting the path to your LineageOS package).
{% if device.is_ab_device %}
5. _(Optionally)_: If you want to install any additional add-ons, run `adb reboot sideload` once more, then `adb sideload /path/to/zip` those packages in sequence.
{% else %}

    {% include alerts/note.html content="If you previously had any Google Apps package installed on your device, you must install an updated package **before** the first boot of Android! If you did not have Google Apps installed, you must wipe the **Data** partition (or perform a factory reset) to install them." %}
{% if device.current_branch == 17.1 %}
6. Once all installations are finished, run 'adb reboot'.
{% else %}
6. _(Optionally)_: Root the device by installing [LineageOS's AddonSU](https://download.lineageos.org/extras), use the `{{ userspace_architecture }}` package.
