## EFS/Persist Backup

{% include alerts/warning.html content="Before processing repartition further we highly recommend you backup persist and EFS using adb or you might lose your IMEI/WIFI + BT mac addresses" %}
1. If you are not in recovery, reboot into recovery:
    * {{ device.recovery_boot }}
2. Now, use the volume buttons to select "Advanced", and then "Enable ADB".
3. Now open Terminal (Linux/macOS), or PowerShell (Windows), run `adb shell`, and then run the following commands within it:
    - `dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p2 of=/sdcard/modemst1.img`
    - `dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p3 of=/sdcard/modemst2.img`
    - `dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p4 of=/sdcard/persist.img`
    - `exit`
4. Now from that same Terminal/PowerShell, run:
    - `adb pull /sdcard/modemst1.img`
    - `adb pull /sdcard/modemst2.img`
    - `adb pull /sdcard/persist.img`

## Repartition
{% include alerts/warning.html content="This step is not optional, the device will not boot LineageOS without repartitioning first!" %}
{% include alerts/warning.html content="This process will wipe all data on the device, including your internal storage!" %}
1. Download the flashable repartition script from [here](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=10763459528675595998).
2. On your device's screen, choose "Apply Update", then "From ADB".
3. From your Terminal/PowerShell, run `adb sideload /path/to/flo-deb_clamor_repartition.zip`, filling `/path/to/` in with the path you downloaded the repartition zip to.
    {% include alerts/warning.html content="This step may take up to 5 minutes, please ensure your USB connection/power source isn't interrupted during this time." %}
4. Now run `adb shell` from your Terminal/PowerShell, and run the following commands within it:
    - `modify`
5. The device will reboot whatever your previous recovery was, please select "Reboot to bootloader" if it's the stock recovery or "Reboot", then "Bootloader" if it was TWRP.
6. Format your data partition:
```
fastboot -w
```
7. Flash recovery onto your device:
```
fastboot flash recovery <recovery_filename>.img
```
    {% include alerts/tip.html content="The file may not be named identically to what stands in this command, so adjust accordingly." %}
    {% include alerts/tip.html content="Some devices have buggy USB support while in bootloader mode, if you see `fastboot` hanging with no output when using commands such as `fastboot getvar .. `, `fastboot boot ...`, `fastboot flash ...` you may want to try a different USB port (preferably a USB Type-A 2.0 one) or a USB hub." %}
8. Now reboot into recovery to verify the installation:
    * {{ device.recovery_boot }}
9. Click,"Factory Reset", then "Format system partition", then when prompted, select "Yes".
