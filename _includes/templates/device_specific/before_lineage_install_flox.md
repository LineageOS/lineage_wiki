3. Now open Terminal (Linux/macOS), or PowerShell (Windows), run `adb shell`, and then run the following commands within it:
    - `dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p2 of=/sdcard/modemst1.img`
    - `dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p3 of=/sdcard/modemst2.img`
    - `dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p4 of=/sdcard/persist.img`
    - `exit`
4. Now from that same Terminal/PowerShell, run:
    - `adb pull /sdcard/modemst1.img`
    - `adb pull /sdcard/modemst2.img`
