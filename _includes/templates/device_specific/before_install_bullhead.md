After the final reboot, if your device hangs at the very first screen,
where just "Google" is displayed, this can be fixed by installing the
[latest major.minor version of stock
android](https://developers.google.com/android/images) that your version
of LineageOS is based on and then installing the LineageOS install zip
again.
