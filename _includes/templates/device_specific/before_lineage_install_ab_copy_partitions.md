## Ensuring all firmware partitions are consistent

{% include alerts/note.html content="The steps below only need to be run once per device." %}

In some cases, the inactive slot can be unpopulated or contain much older firmware than the active slot, leading to various issues including a potential hard-brick. We can ensure none of that will happen by copying the contents of the active slot to the inactive slot.

To do this, sideload the `copy-partitions-20220613-signed.zip` package by doing the following:
1. Download the `copy-partitions-20220613-signed.zip` file from [here](https://mirrorbits.lineageos.org/tools/copy-partitions-20220613-signed.zip). It should have a MD5 sum of `79f2f860830f023b7030c29bfbea7737` or a SHA-256 sum of `92f03b54dc029e9ca2d68858c14b649974838d73fdb006f9a07a503f2eddd2cd`.
{%- if device.uses_twrp %}
2. Sideload the `copy-partitions-20220613-signed.zip` package:
    * On the device, select "Advanced", "ADB Sideload", then swipe to begin sideload
    * On the host machine, sideload the package using: `adb -d sideload copy-partitions-20220613-signed.zip`
{%- else %}
2. Sideload the `copy-partitions-20220613-signed.zip` package:
    * On the device, select "Apply Update", then "Apply from ADB" to begin sideload.
    * On the host machine, sideload the package using: `adb -d sideload copy-partitions-20220613-signed.zip`
    {% include alerts/note.html content="The copy-partitions script was created by LineageOS developer erfanoabdi and filipepferraz" %}
3. Now reboot to recovery by tapping "Advanced", then "Reboot to recovery".
