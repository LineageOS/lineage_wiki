## Pre-Install Instructions

The latest DRG firmware suffers from an unknown bug that triggers a false data-corruption warning when updating LineageOS via the in-built Updater app. To mitigate this issue, reflash the latest stock firmware for your model.

{% include alerts/warning.html content="An official method of reflashing the stock firmware is not available, but there may be some unofficial methods available. Unofficial methods are not recommended or supported by LineageOS, so use them at your own risk! Proceeding to the installation of LineageOS without reflashing stock firmware will render device unable to update via builtin Updater app." %}
