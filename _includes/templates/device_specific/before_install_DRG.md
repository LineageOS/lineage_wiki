## Pre-Install Notice

Unofficial bootloader unlocks for this device tend to leave the device in a strange state. This can cause a false data-corruption notice when updating LineageOS via the built-in Updater app.

To mitigate this issue, reflash the latest stock firmware for your model before starting.

{% include alerts/warning.html content="An official method of reflashing the stock firmware is not available, but there may be some unofficial methods available. Unofficial methods are not supported by LineageOS, so use them at your own risk! Proceeding with the installation of LineageOS without reflashing stock firmware will render device unable to update via built-in Updater app." %}
