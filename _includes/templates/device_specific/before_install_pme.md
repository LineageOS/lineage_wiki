### Installing on Sprint or Verizon variants

Thanks to firmware incompatibilities, these variants are unsupported, even if they are bootlaoder unlocked.

Some people have reported success converting these variants to the Retail/Developer Edition by changing CID & MID, the RUU'ing to that firmware.

We don't support this, though you're welcome to head over to XDA and try it yourself, your mileage may vary.
