{% include alerts/warning.html content=" Thanks to firmware incompatibilities, the Sprint and Verizon variants are unsupported, even if the devices are bootloader unlocked. Some people have reported success converting these variants to the Retail/Developer Edition by changing CID & MID, then RUU'ing to that firmware. We don't support this, though you're welcome to head over to XDA and try it yourself. Your mileage may vary." %}
