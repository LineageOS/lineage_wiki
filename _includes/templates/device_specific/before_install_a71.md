## Firmware Requirements

- To install LineageOS on this device, you should meets some requirements:

1. Unlocked bootloader.
2. The recommendation is to run the latest OneUI 5.1. since Samsung doesn't give us 6.x.
3. If you're running OneUI 5.0 is pretty enough to run this rom, also do not upgrade to 5.1 if you wanted to keep the old bootloader.

- Note:

1. The table below explains the difference between OneUI 5.0 and 5.1 in terms of CSC, Version, BIT/Binary, OS, Security Patches Level.
