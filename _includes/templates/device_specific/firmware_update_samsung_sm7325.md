There are two possibilities to get the latest firmware:

### You are still on the stock OS with locked bootloader

1. Simply perform OTA updates until the device reports that no updates are available.

### You already installed a custom recovery

1. Download the latest firmware for your model [here](https://github.com/Simon1511/samsung-sm7325-fw/releases) (All `.tar.md5` files)
   {% include alerts/note.html content="You can find your model number under About Phone in your phone's Settings app!" %}
2. Flash the just downloaded files using Odin. You can have a look at the [recovery installation instructions]({{ device | device_link: "/install" | append: "#installing-a-custom-recovery-using-odin" | relative_url }}) if you forgot how to do that.
   {% include alerts/note.html content="The filenames will give you a hint on which slot to flash each file to!" %}
