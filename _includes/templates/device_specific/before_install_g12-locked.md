## Unlocking the bootloader

These instructions will only work on devices that have not yet been updated past the April 2024 Security Patch Level to the August 2024 OTA or later.

You can check this in the Settings application under the "System", "About" tab, labeled "Security Patch Level".

If you have not yet setup your device, **do not** set it up to check the version, just proceed with the installation instructions, as the setup process forcibly updates the device.

If you're unable to boot into "Burn Mode" later in these instructions, and instead are taken to a screen which says "No Comamnd", you can assume that your device was updated past the April 2024 OTA.

If your device was updated past this build, it is not able to be get into "Burn Mode", and therefore cannot be bootloader unlocked, and you cannot run LineageOS on that device.

Downgrading to older builds is not a viable option.

If your device is on the April 2024 OTA, or a build that preceeds it, you can proceed.
