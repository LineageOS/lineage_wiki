## Important information

There are two possible hardware configurations of this phone regardless of model number.
Some phones were released with a Sony IMX 175 rear camera sensor, while others with a Samsung s5k4h5yb rear camera sensor.
As such, we've separated this device's builds into two separate builds.
The procedure to distinguish which to use is as follows:

* Make sure to be on the latest stock firmware of your variant (you can check updates with Settings, Updates);
* Make sure the rear camera is working on the stock ROM;
* Open the phone app and dial `*#*#34971539#*#*` to access to the hidden menu;
* Tap on 'Phone/Cam FW Check' and take note of the numbers shown in the notification:
	* For `E08QT`, install the s3ve3gjv builds
	* For `B08QT`, install the s3ve3gxx builds

If neither of these match, please make sure you installed the correct firmware version.
