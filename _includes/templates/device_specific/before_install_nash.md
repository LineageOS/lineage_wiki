## Firmware Requirements

Before following these instructions please ensure that the device is on the latest firmware available for your variant. To discern this, run the command `adb -d shell getprop ro.boot.hardware.sku`. Please refer to the table below to discern what the latest firmware for your variant is:

| Variant | Version |
|---------|---------|
| XT1789-02/03/04 | 8.0 |
| XT1789-05/06/07 | 9.0 |
{: .table }

If the device's firmware version doesn't match the version required above, please go into "Settings", "System", "System Updates", click "Check for Updates", and apply any available. You may need to do this multiple times.
