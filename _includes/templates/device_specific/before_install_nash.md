{% include alerts/warning.html content="Before following these instructions please ensure that the device is on the latest firmware available for your variant. To discern this, run the command `adb shell getprop ro.boot.hardware.sku` after following the steps under the `Basic Requirements` header below. For XT1789-02/03/04 models that will be a Oreo (8.0) build, and for XT1789-05/06/07 that will be a Pie (9.0) build. If you follow these instructions on any other firmware (eg. Nougat 7.0/7.1.1), or a firmware not intended for your variant, you are very likely to damage the device." %}
