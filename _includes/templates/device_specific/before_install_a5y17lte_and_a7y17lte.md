## Important information

Older TWRP versions had an issue where formatting the data partition would not leave space for the encryption footer LineageOS relies on. If your device fails to encrypt, update your TWRP to the latest version and follow the [manual upgrade](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/a5y17lte/upgrade#manually-upgrading-lineageos upgrade) procedure.
