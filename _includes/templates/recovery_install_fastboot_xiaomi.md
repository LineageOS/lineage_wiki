## Unlocking the bootloader

{% include alerts/note.html content="The steps below only need to be run once per device. They **require** a machine running Windows 7 or newer." %}
{% include alerts/note.html content="Unlocking a new Xiaomi device has become quite different depending on the region. Thereâ€™s no official way to unlock new CN devices. For some other regions, you need to apply for unlocking through the Mi-Community app at a specific time to be able to unlock the device." %}
{% include alerts/warning.html content="Unlocking the bootloader will erase all data on your device! Before proceeding, ensure the data you would like to retain is backed up to your PC and/or your Google account, or equivalent. Please note that OEM backup solutions like Samsung and Motorola backup may not be accessible from LineageOS once installed." %}

1. Create a Mi account on [Xiaomi's website](https://global.account.xiaomi.com/pass/register). Beware that one account is only allowed to unlock one unique device every 30 days.
2. Add a phone number to your Mi account.
3. Insert a SIM into your phone.
4. Enable developer options in `Settings` > `About Phone` by repeatedly tapping `MIUI Version`.
5. Enable OEM unlocking `Settings` > `Additional settings` > `Developer options` > `OEM unlocking`. Some models may required to restart.
6. Enable USB debugging in `Settings` > `Additional settings` > `Developer options` > `USB debugging`.
7. Turn off wifi and instead turn on mobile data.
8. Link the device to your Mi account in `Settings` > `Additional settings` > `Developer options` > `Mi Unlock status`.
9. Download the [Mi Unlock app](https://en.miui.com/unlock/download_en.html) (Windows is required to run the app). If problems occured with running the app you can try download the latest version with button in setting of app or try to download different version of app from the internet.
10. Connect phone to computer via USB and boot phone to `fastboot` mode, when your phone is powered off hold button volume down and power button. This step is required to properly install Mi USB driver.
11. If driver for youe phone did not install automatically by Mi Unlock app, you can install it manually with button in app or with the file `MiUsbDriver.exe` included in zip archive next to `miflash_unlock.exe`. You have to see message that driver was succesfully installed, otherwise Mi Unlock app may not detect your device.
12. Run the Mi Unlock app and follow the instructions provided by the app. It may tell you that you have to wait up to 30 days. If it does so, please wait the quoted amount of time before continuing to the next step!
13. After device and Mi account are successfully verified, the bootloader should be unlocked.
14. Since the device resets completely, you will need to re-enable USB debugging to continue.
