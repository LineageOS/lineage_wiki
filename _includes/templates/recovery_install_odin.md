## Important Information

{% include alerts/note.html content="The following instructions **require** a machine running Windows 10 build 17063 or newer." %}

Samsung devices come with a unique boot mode called "Download mode", which is very similar to "Fastboot mode" on some devices with unlocked bootloaders.
Odin is a Samsung-made tool for interfacing with Download mode on Samsung devices.
The preferred method of installing a custom recovery is through Download Mode{% unless custom_root_instructions %} -- rooting the stock firmware is neither necessary nor required{% endunless %}.
