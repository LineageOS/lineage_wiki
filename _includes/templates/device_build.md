## Introduction

These instructions will hopefully assist you to start with a stock {{ device.vendor }} {{ device.name }}, unlock the bootloader (if necessary), and then download
the required tools as well as the very latest source code for LineageOS (based on Google’s Android operating system) for your device. Using these, you can build both
a LineageOS installation zip and a LineageOS Recovery image and install them on your device.

It is difficult to say how much experience is necessary to follow these instructions. While this guide is certainly not for the extremely uninitiated,
these steps shouldn’t require a PhD in software development either. Some readers will have no difficulty and breeze through the steps easily.
Others may struggle over the most basic operation. Because people’s experiences, backgrounds, and intuitions differ, it may be a good idea to read through
just to ascertain whether you feel comfortable or are getting over your head.

Remember, you assume all risk of trying this, but you will reap the rewards! It’s pretty satisfying to boot into a fresh operating system you baked at home :).
And once you’re an Android-building ninja, there will be no more need to wait for “nightly” builds from anyone. You will have at your fingertips the skills to
build a full operating system from code and install it to a running device, whenever you want. Where you go from there-- maybe you’ll add a feature, fix a bug, add a translation,
or use what you’ve learned to build a new app or port to a new device-- or maybe you’ll never build again-- it’s all really up to you.

### What you'll need

* A {{ device.vendor }} {{ device.name }}.
* A relatively recent 64-bit computer (Linux, macOS, or Windows) with a reasonable amount of RAM and about 200 GB of free storage (more if you enable `ccache`
 or build for multiple devices). The less RAM you have, the longer the build will take. Aim for 16 GB RAM or more, enabling ZRAM can be helpful. Using SSDs results in considerably faster
 build times than traditional hard drives.
* A USB cable compatible with the {{ device.vendor }} {{device.name}}.
* A decent internet connection and reliable electricity. :)
* Some familiarity with basic Android operation and terminology. It would help if you've installed custom roms on other devices and are familiar with recovery.
 It may also be useful to know some basic command line concepts such as `cd`, which stands for “change directory”, the concept of directory hierarchies, and that in Linux they are separated by /, etc.

{% include alerts/tip.html content="If you are not accustomed to using Linux, this is an excellent chance to learn. It’s free -- just download and run a virtual machine (VM) such as
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), then install a Linux distribution such as [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) ([AOSP vets Ubuntu as well](https://source.android.com/source/initializing.html)).
Any recent 64-bit version should work great, but the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version is recommended. There are plenty of instructions on setting up VirtualBox to run Ubuntu, so we'll leave that to you." %}

Let's begin!

## Build LineageOS and LineageOS Recovery

{% include alerts/note.html content="You only need to do these steps once. If you have already prepared your build environment and downloaded the source code,
skip to [Prepare the device-specific code](#prepare-the-device-specific-code)" %}

{% include templates/device_build_host_setup.md %}


### Initialize the LineageOS source repository

{% if device.maintainers != empty %}
The following branches are officially supported for the {{ device.vendor }} {{ device.name }}:
{% else %}
The following branches can be used to build for the {{ device.vendor }} {{ device.name }}:
{% endif %}

{% for version in device.versions %}
{% if version < 15 %}
* cm-{{ version }}
{% else %}
* lineage-{{ version }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Enter the following to initialize the repository:

{% include alerts/note.html content="Make sure the branch you enter here is the one you wish to build!" %}

```
cd ~/android/lineage
repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b {% if device.current_branch < 15 %}cm{% else %}lineage{% endif %}-{{ device.current_branch }}
```

### Download the source code

To start the download of the source code to your computer, type the following:

```
repo sync
```

The LineageOS manifests include a sensible default configuration for repo, which we strongly suggest you use (i.e. don't add any options to sync).
For reference, our default values are `-j 4` and `-c`. The `-j 4` part means that there will be four simultaneous threads/connections. If you experience
problems syncing, you can lower this to `-j 3` or `-j 2`. On the other hand, `-c` will ask repo to pull in only the current branch instead of all branches that are available on GitHub.

{% include alerts/note.html content="This may take a while, depending on your internet speed. Go and have a beer/coffee/tea/nap in the meantime!" %}

{% include alerts/tip.html content="The `repo sync` command is used to update the latest source code from LineageOS and Google. Remember it, as you may want to
do it every few days to keep your code base fresh and up-to-date." %}

### Prepare the device-specific code

After the source downloads, ensure you're in the root of the source code (`cd ~/android/lineage`), then type:

```
source build/envsetup.sh
breakfast {{ device.codename }}
```

This will download your device's [device specific configuration](https://github.com/LineageOS/{{ device.tree }}) and
[kernel](https://github.com/LineageOS/{{ device.kernel }}).

{% include alerts/important.html content="Some devices require a vendor directory to be populated before breakfast will succeed. If you receive an error here about vendor
makefiles, jump down to [_Extract proprietary blobs_](#extract-proprietary-blobs). The first portion of breakfast should have succeeded, and after completing you can [rerun
`breakfast`](#prepare-the-device-specific-code)" %}

### Extract proprietary blobs

{% capture extracting_blobs_from_zips %}
This step requires to have a device already running the latest LineageOS, based on the branch you wish to build for. If you don't have access to such device, refer to [Extracting proprietary blobs from installable zip]({{ "extracting_blobs_from_zips.html" | relative_url }}).
{% endcapture %}
{% include alerts/note.html content=extracting_blobs_from_zips %}

Now ensure your {{ device.name }} is connected to your computer via the USB cable, with ADB and root enabled, and that you are in the
`~/android/lineage/device/{{ device.vendor_short }}/{{ device.codename }}` folder. Then run the `extract-files.sh` script:

```
./extract-files.sh
```

The blobs should be pulled into the `~/android/lineage/vendor/{{ device.vendor_short }}` folder. If you see "command not found" errors, `adb` may
need to be placed in `~/bin`.


### Start the build

Time to start building! Now, type:

```
croot
brunch {{device.codename}}
```

The build should begin.

{% capture signing_builds %}
Want to learn how to sign your own builds? Take a look at [Signing builds]({{ "signing_builds.html" | relative_url }}).
{% endcapture %}
{% include alerts/tip.html content=signing_builds %}

## Install the build

Assuming the build completed without errors (it will be obvious when it finishes), type the following in the terminal window the build ran in:

```
cd $OUT
```

There you'll find all the files that were created. The two files of more interest are:

{% if device.is_ab_device %}
1. `boot.img`, which is the LineageOS boot image, and contains the recovery-ramdisk.
{% else %}
1. `recovery.img`, which is the LineageOS recovery image.
{% endif %}
2. `lineage-{{ device.current_branch }}-{{ site.time | date: "%Y%m%d" }}-UNOFFICIAL-{{ device.codename }}.zip`, which is the LineageOS
installer package.

### Success! So... what's next?

You've done it! Welcome to the elite club of self-builders. You've built your operating system from scratch, from the ground up. You are the master/mistress of your domain... and
hopefully you've learned a bit on the way and had some fun too.
