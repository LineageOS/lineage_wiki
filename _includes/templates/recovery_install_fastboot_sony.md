## Unlocking the bootloader

{% include note.html content="The steps below only need to be run once per device." %}
{% include warning.html content="Unlocking the bootloader will erase all data on your device!
Before proceeding, ensure the data you would like to retain is backed up to your PC and/or your Google account, or equivalent." %}

1. Dial `*#*#7378423#*#*` (`*#*#SERVICE#*#*`) to launch the service menu.
2. Go to `service info` > `configuration` and check "rooting status" - you can only continue if it says `Bootloader unlock allowed: Yes`.
3. Make sure your computer has working [fastboot and adb]({{ "adb_fastboot_guide.html" | relative_url }}).
4. Enable [USB debugging]({{ "adb_fastboot_guide.html#setting-up-adb" | relative_url }}) on your device.
5. Get the current status of your bootloader:

    Open a terminal on the PC and boot the device to fastboot mode by typing:

        adb reboot bootloader

    {% if site.data.devices[page.device].download_boot %}
    You can also boot into fastboot mode via a key combination:

    * {{ site.data.devices[page.device].download_boot }}
    {% endif %}

    Once the device is in fastboot mode, verify your PC detects it by typing:

        fastboot devices

   If you see `no permissions fastboot` or `<waiting for device>`, try running `fastboot` as root/Administrator.

6. Follow the instructions on [developer.sonymobile.com](http://developer.sonymobile.com/unlockbootloader/unlock-yourboot-loader/) to unlock your bootloader.
