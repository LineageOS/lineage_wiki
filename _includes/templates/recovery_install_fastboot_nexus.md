## Unlocking the bootloader

{% include alerts/note.html content="The steps below only need to be run once per device." %}
{% include alerts/warning.html content="Unlocking the bootloader will erase all data on your device!
Before proceeding, ensure the data you would like to retain is backed up to your PC and/or your Google account, or equivalent. Please note that OEM backup solutions like Samsung and Motorola backup may not be accessible from LineageOS once installed." %}

{% unless device.no_oem_unlock_switch %}
1. Enable OEM unlock in the Developer options under device Settings, if present.
{% endunless %}
2. Connect the device to your PC via USB.
3. On the computer, open a command prompt (on Windows) or terminal (on Linux or macOS) window, and type:
```
adb reboot bootloader
```
    {% if device.download_boot %}
    You can also boot into fastboot mode via a key combination:

    * {{ device.download_boot }}
    {% endif %}
4. Once the device is in fastboot mode, verify your PC finds it by typing:
```
fastboot devices
```
    {% include alerts/tip.html content="If you see `no permissions fastboot` while on Linux or macOS, try running `fastboot` as root." %}
5. Now type the following command to unlock the bootloader:

{% if device.custom_unlock_cmd %}
    ```
{{ device.custom_unlock_cmd }}
    ```
{% else %}
    ```
fastboot oem unlock
    ```
{% endif %}

6. If the device doesn't automatically reboot, reboot it. It should now be unlocked.
7. Since the device resets completely, you will need to re-enable USB debugging to continue.

{% if device.before_recovery_install %}
{% capture path %}templates/device_specific/{{ device.before_recovery_install }}.md{% endcapture %}
{% include {{ path }} %}
{% endif %}

{% if device.is_ab_device and device.has_recovery_partition != true %}
{% include templates/recovery_install_fastboot_ab.md %}
{% else %}
{% include templates/recovery_install_fastboot_generic.md %}
{% endif %}
