## Unlocking the bootloader

{% include alerts/note.html content="The steps below need to be run for each bootloader session." %}

1. Enable OEM unlock in the Developer options under device Settings, if present.
2. Connect the device to your PC via USB.
3. On the computer, open a command prompt (on Windows) or terminal (on Linux or macOS) window, and type:
```
adb -d reboot bootloader
```
    {% if device.download_boot %}
    You can also boot into fastboot mode via a key combination:

    * {{ device.download_boot }}
    {% endif %}
4. Once the device is in fastboot mode, verify your PC finds it by typing:
```
fastboot devices
```
  If you don't get any output or an error:
   * on Windows: make sure the device appears in the device manager without a triangle. Try other drivers until the command above works!
   * on Linux or macOS: If you see `no permissions fastboot` try running `fastboot` as root. When the output is empty, check your USB cable and port!
5. Now type the following command to unlock the bootloader:

{% if device.custom_unlock_cmd %}
    ```
{{ device.custom_unlock_cmd }}
    ```
{% else %}
    ```
fastboot oem unlock
    ```
{% endif %}
6. The device is now ready to flash images, do not reboot the device before flashing.
