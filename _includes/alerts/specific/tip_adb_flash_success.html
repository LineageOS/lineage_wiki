Normally, adb will report `Total xfer: 1.00x`, but in some cases, even if the process succeeds the output will stop at 47% and report `adb: failed to read command: Success`.
In some cases it will report `adb: failed to read command: No error` or `adb: failed to read command: Undefined error: 0` which is also fine.
