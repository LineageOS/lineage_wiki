Normally, adb reports `Total xfer: 1.00x`, but in some cases, even if the process succeeds, the output may stop at 47% and show `adb: failed to read command: Success`. 
In other instances, it might display `adb: failed to read command: No error` or `adb: failed to read command: Undefined error: 0` which is also fine.
