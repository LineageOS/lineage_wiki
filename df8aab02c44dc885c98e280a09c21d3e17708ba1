Y\u0027all can\u0027t keep track of this yourselves alone.\n\n```suggestion\n - If your model is not listed, it\u0027s not supported. We don\u0027t have info about the reasoning, please don\u0027t ask! If you\u0027ve went the dangerous route and found that a specific model you have works, you can submit it in the wiki to let others know.\n```",
