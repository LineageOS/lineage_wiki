Y\u0027all can\u0027t keep track of this yourselves alone.\n\n```suggestion\n - If your model is not listed, it\u0027s not supported. We don\u0027t have info about the reasoning, please don\u0027t ask! If you\u0027ve went the dangerous route and found that a specific model you have works, you can submit it in the wiki to let others know.\n```",

      "message": "A suggestion in the long term could be to have a field for strictly *unsupported* devices, it\u0027d be more work to add to the wiki than a simple text edit, but it\u0027d be nicer info than how it currently works, when you leave a hole like this \"will my device not work/be bricked\" and no info about previously tested models at all, you\u0027ll spark curiosity without certainty that *will* result in a question. Like it or not, many types of people would like to try LineageOS or overall a custom ROM out there, better to properly inform them than to be vague about it.",

      "message": "We are glad the wiki is as \"accurate\" as it already is. Getting maintainers to maintain such a list can or can not work, leaning on the latter.\nTherefore I want this to be a FAQ question that leaves no room for \"could it anyway\" which leads to them joining discord or irc and asking - literally with NO other answer than \"we don\u0027t know\", often followed by \"try it\" (but that one isn\u0027t backed by any knowledge about known breakages). I guess leaving the \"test it\" out is the better way here",
