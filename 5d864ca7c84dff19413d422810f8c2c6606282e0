      "message": "There are two possible hardware configurations of this phone (regardless of model number): Phones with Sony imx175 rear camera sensors, and phones with Samsung s5k4h5yb rear camera sensors. As such, we\u0027ve separated this devices builds into two district builds.\n\nTo discern which to use, please install the firmware recommended for your device under \"Special Requirements\" below, make sure the camera is working properly, then open the phone app and dial `*#34971539#*` to open up the hidden menu. On this menu, click on “Phone/Cam FW Check” and take note of the numbers shown in the notification.\n\nFor `E08QT`, install the s3ve3gjv builds. \nFor `B08QT`, install the s3ve3gxx builds.\n\nIf neither of these match, please make sure you installed the correct firmware version.",
