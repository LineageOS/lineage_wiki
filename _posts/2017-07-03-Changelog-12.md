## Welcome to LineageOS' biweekly review, where we go over changes in the last couple of weeks

### Major changes since June 12th

* Jelly has been vastly improved:
  * When a download is completed, a notification is now shown, and a scan for new files is now run
  * Links in incognito tabs are now opened in new incognito tabs
  * A shortcut can now be created directly to a new incognito tab
  * Form data (e.g. usernames, passwords are not saved) is now saved by default
  * Do not track option can now be enabled
  * Search suggestions are now available, including:
    * Baidu
    * Bing
    * DuckDuckGo (default)
    * Google
    * Yahoo
    * None
  * Links can now be opened in external apps (e.g. YouTube links can be opened in the YouTube app)
  * [Safe browsing](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/06/whats-new-in-webview-security.html) is now supported
* The [sensitive numbers list](https://www.lineageos.org/Changelog-10/) has been expanded:
  * Brazil, France, Portugal, and the UK have new numbers included
  * Sensitive numbers for Greece, Taiwan, and Ukraine have been added
  * Country detection for the Czech Republic has been fixed
* A longstanding issue affecting tap-to-pay on several devices has now been fixed
* Media codecs have been updated
* A timeout for the 'long press power button for torch' option can now be set. You can find this option in Settings > Buttons > Automatically turn torch off
* The clock app can now set a system profile when an alarm triggers
* The Location QS tile can now be toggled without fully expanding the status bar
* The Battery Saver QS tile has been removed, as this functionality is already available in the main Battery QS tile
* Custom tiles have been integrated into the framework now to allow for deeper integration with the system, and mimic behavior from older versions. In the next few weeks keep an eye out for new tiles being forward ported.
* The updater app now prevents major version upgrades (e.g. 13.0 to 14.1) from being automatically installed, in order to prevent the situation where the user doesn't notice the change and ends up with incompatible add-ons

### Infrastructure

* The [CVE tracker](https://cve.lineageos.org/) has seen a major redesign, and completion percentage calculation has been improved
* The [downloads page](https://download.lineageos.org/) now shows `sha256` and `sha1` checksums instead of `md5`
* Weather providers are now available on the [extras page](https://download.lineageos.org/extras)
