      "message": "Hello Harry! Thank you very much for reviewing. It\u0027s so nice to see people reviewing the code real quick. I know I haven\u0027t done much and I shouldn\u0027t have put my name there, but I don\u0027t know what to put in there. Can you elaborate on how I can be a maintainer? :)\n\nLooking forward to contribute as much as I can :)",
