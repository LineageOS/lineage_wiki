## Error 7 in TWRP
 - Either:
  - you are flashing the zip for a different device
  - You need to flash the experimental build if you are migrating from CM13/CM14.1. After this, boot, then flash the regular build
  - vendor or firmware or bootloader is too old, try flashing some new stock images first
  - there is another error below it. Post it in IRC (#lineageos@freenode) or on the [Subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/lineageos) under the weekly question thread 
 
## Horrible watermarks everywhere
 - You need to flash the normal version after booting the experimental one
 
## Where's ma device download?
 - Be patient. Devices are slowly being built. If it's not on [this page](http://wiki.lineageos.org/devices.html), it's not officially supported, so will not be built. Do not ask for ETAs. It will build when it's ready
 
## I found a bug. What do I do?
 - Hold ya horses. Does the bug occur on a clean install (eg. Wipe data and try again). If it does, great, you've found a bug. This will soon be able to be reported on [Jira](http://jira.lineageos.org) - the bug reporting system. Wait until then, and do *not* post it on the subreddit as it's own thread
 
## Can I have _xxx_ feature added?
 - No. Well, maybe. At the moment, we're looking to fix bugs and actually work on fixing _major_ features missing. [Jira](http://jira.lineageos.org) will *eventually* begin taking feature requests, where you can submit your novel idea.

## Are there any bugs?
 - Yes. You'll be able to track them on [Jira](http://jira.lineageos.org)
