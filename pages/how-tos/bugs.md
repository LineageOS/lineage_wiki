## Reporting a bug

We use [Gitlab Issues](https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues) as our bug tracker. Before you submit a bug, please search to verify that someone else hasn't reported it already. If they have, avoid commenting with "+1" or "Me too!", as this just creates more work for us.

We accept bugs on the following:

  - [Android](https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues/android)
    - These are bugs in LineageOS.
    - Examples:
      - The fingerprint sensor on your device doesn't work.
      - Your phone crashes when you try to enable encryption.
      - WiFi calling doesn't work.

    {% include alerts/important.html content="Please do not post multiple issues within the same report, as bugs can be either affecting different maintainers or some may be device specific where others are not" %}

    {% include alerts/important.html content="[Logcats](logcat.html) *must* be attached for all android bugs, and *must* be captured right after reproducing the issue." %}

  - [Infrastructure](https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues/infra)
    - These are bugs in our website and/or software.
    - Examples:
      - The download portal doesn't render something correctly.
      - There's a dead link on the website.
      - An API returns something unexpected.


    {% include alerts/important.html content="If the issue affects your device, this is the **wrong** place to report your issue!" %}

Please be sure to fill out the template with accurate information, and in the format requested. It doesn't matter if your baseband version has nothing to do with a lock screen animation issue, if it is not there your bug will be removed.
