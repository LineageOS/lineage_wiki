## Introduction

Proprietary blobs can be extracted either from a device already running LineageOS or from a LineageOS installable zip. In this guide we will describe the steps required to extract proprietary files from installable zips.

Before beginning, it is required to know the difference between block-based OTAs and file-based OTAs. In a file-based OTA the content of the system partition is available inside a folder of the zip named `system`. In a block-based OTA the content of the system partition is stored inside of a file as binary data. If your zip has no `system` folder or an almost empty `system` folder, and a file named `system.transfer.list` in its root, then what you have is a block-based OTAs. Jump to [Extracting proprietary blobs from block-based OTAs](#extracting-proprietary-blobs-from-block-based-otas) in this case. If you have the entire content of the system partition inside the `system` folder and no `system.transfer.list`, then what you have is a file-based OTA. See [Extracting proprietary blobs from file-based OTAs](#extracting-proprietary-blobs-from-file-based-otas).

## Extracting proprietary blobs from block-based OTAs

Create a temporary directory and move there:

```
mkdir ~/android/system_dump/
cd ~/android/system_dump/
```

Extract `system.transfer.list` and `system.new.dat` from the installable LineageOS zip:

```
unzip path/to/lineage-*.zip system.transfer.list system.new.dat
```
where `path/to/` is the path to the installable zip.

You now need to get a copy of `sdat2img`. This script can convert the content of block-based OTAs into dumps that can be mounted. `sdat2img` is available at the following git repository that you can clone with:

```
git clone https://github.com/xpirt/sdat2img
```

Once you have obtained `sdat2img`, use it to extract the system image:

```
python sdat2img/sdat2img.py system.transfer.list system.new.dat system.img
```

You should now have a file named `system.img` that you can mount as follows:

```
mkdir system/
sudo mount system.img system/
```

After you have mounted the image, move to the root directory of the sources of your device and run `extract-files.sh` as follows:

```
./extract-files.sh -p ~/android/system_dump/
```
Or, if the above command fails:

```
./extract-files.sh ~/android/system_dump/
```
This will tell `extract-files.sh` to get the files from the mounted system dump rather than from a connected device.

Once you've extracted all the proprietary files, unmount the system dump and delete the no longer needed files:

```
sudo umount ~/android/system_dump/system
rm -rf ~/android/system_dump/
```

## Extracting proprietary blobs from file-based OTAs

Create a temporary directory to extract the content of the zip and move there:

```
mkdir ~/android/system_dump/
cd ~/android/system_dump/
```

Extract the `system` folder from the zip:

```
unzip path/to/lineage-*.zip system/*
```
where `path/to/` is the path to the installable zip.

After you have extracted the `system` folder, move to the root directory of the sources of your device and run `extract-files.sh` as follows:

```
./extract-files.sh -p ~/android/system_dump/
```
Or, if the above command fails:

```
./extract-files.sh ~/android/system_dump/
```
This will tell `extract-files.sh` to get the files from the extracted system dump rather than from a connected device.

Once you've extracted all the proprietary files, you can delete the files that were extracted from the zip:

```
rm -rf ~/android/system_dump/
```
