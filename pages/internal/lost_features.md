## Lost Features

LineageOS has a long history, spanning across multiple Android versions. Over this time, a long list of
extra features has been added to the 'stock' Android experience, making it unique.
Every new release of Android by Google requires these changes to be 'ported', that is, every single feature
needs to be taken and - where necessary - adapted on top of whatever changes were done by Google.

Unfortunately, often these features required heavy and complex changes to the Android codebase, and there
has not been enough manpower available (yet) to have them make their way back into LineageOS.

Porting an old feature into current versions of LineageOS will be greatly appreciated by everyone!


### List of lost features

This is an incomplete list: if you know of such a feature, you're very welcomed to [contribute to it]({{ "contributing.html"

#### Quick Unlock

When using PIN/password lock screens, it allowed to not have to press the Enter key; instead, the device would unlock immediately after
entering the correct code.

**Lost:** CM13. [Port attempted](https://review.lineageos.org/#/q/topic:quick-unlock).
