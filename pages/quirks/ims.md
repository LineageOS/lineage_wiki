## IMS

To read about IMS in general, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Multimedia_Subsystem).
You have been redirected here because LineageOS builds for your device do not support IMS functions.

### Why is that?

While it certainly is a standard, there is no standard implementation for it in the Android sourcecode.
Some vendors have their own implementation, which is not open-source and can therefore not be integrated into LineageOS' code.
Devices that rely on any of these implementations therefore lack the all features provided by IMS (VoLTE, VoWi-Fi, VoNR, etc.).
This might or might not affect you, depending on your provider and region.
