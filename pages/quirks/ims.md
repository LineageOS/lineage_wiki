## IMS

To read about IMS in general, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Multimedia_Subsystem).
You have probably been redirected here because your device does not support it.

### Why is that?

While it certainly is a standard, there is no standard implementation for it in the Android sourcecode.
Some vendors have their own implementation, which is not open-sourced and can therefore not be integrated into LineageOS' code.
Devices that rely on any of these implementations therefore lack the whole feature. This might or might not affect you, depending on your provider.
