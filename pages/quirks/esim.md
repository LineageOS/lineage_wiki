## eSIM

To read about eSIM in general, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eSIM).
You have been redirected here because LineageOS builds for your device do not support eSIM functions.

### Why is that?

While it is somewhat standardized, most devices have no open-source implementation of an enrollment application available.
This means that maintainers are forced to utilize prebuilt applications from vendors/carriers, and the one for this device is incompatible with modern versions of Android.
This might or might not affect you, depending on your usecase.
