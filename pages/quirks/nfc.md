## NFC

To read about NFC in general, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication).
You have been redirected here because LineageOS builds for your device do not support NFC functions.

### Why is that?

While it is certainly standardized, some NFC chipsets have no implemnetation available.
Some chipsets have their own implementation, which is not open-sourced and can therefore not be integrated into LineageOS' code.
Devices that rely on any of these implementations therefore lack the all features provided by NFC.
This might or might not affect you, depending on your usecase.
