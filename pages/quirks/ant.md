## ANT+

To read about ANT+ in general, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT_(network)).
You have been redirected here because LineageOS builds for your device do not support ANT+ functions.

### Why is that?

ANT+ relies on proprietary binaries included in the stock ROM for your device, and those are targetted at a specific Android version.
Unfortunately, these binaries are too old to function on modern Android versions.
Unless you already knew what ANT+ was and utilize it, this will likely not affect you.
