## In-remote microphone

You have been redirected here because LineageOS builds for your device do not support the in-remote microphone(s) on the remote that was included with your device.

### Why is that?

Previous to roughly 2018, there was no standardized implementation available for in-remote microphone audio routing.
Some vendors created their own implementation, which is not open-source and can therefore not be integrated into LineageOS' code.
This might or might not affect you, depending on your usecase, but the Android TV & Google Home applications microphone input functions will work if you install GApps..
