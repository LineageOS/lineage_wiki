## Docking Station

Some devices have dedicated docking stations that provide functions like video-out, audio-out, cast reciever, etc.
You have been redirected here because LineageOS builds for your device do not support this docking stations functions.

### Why is that?

Some vendors have their own implementation, which is not open-sourced and can therefore not be integrated into LineageOS' code.
This might or might not affect you, depending on your usecase.
