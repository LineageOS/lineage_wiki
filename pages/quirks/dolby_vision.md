## Dolby Vision

You have been redirected here because LineageOS builds for your device do not support Dolby Vision, or local Dolby content decoding.

### Why is that?

This feature is heavily proprietary and guarded to only function on devices running the stock ROM with the bootloader locked.

This cannot be bypassed as it is routed through the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
