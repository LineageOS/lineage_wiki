## Dolby Vision

You have been redirected here because LineageOS builds for your device do not support Dolby Vision, or local Dolby content decoding.

### Why is that?

This feature is heavily proprietary and guarded to only function on devices running the stock ROM with the bootloader locked.

It is additionally protected by a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) function called `ipprotect` encryption that further complicates OSS support of the feature.
