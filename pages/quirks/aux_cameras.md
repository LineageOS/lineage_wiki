## Auxillary/Periphial Cameras

Some devices ship with auxillary cameras, being any camera that is included outside of the rear-main and rear-front sensors.
Some devices ship with periphial cameras (Moto Camera Mods, 360-Camera Accessories, Attachable USB Cameras, etc.)
You have been redirected here because LineageOS builds for your device do not support these cameras/accessories.

### Why is that?

Vendors often handle auxillary cameras in entirely custom ways, often not exposing an accessible camera ID to the OS, relying instead of OEM specific applications that often have framework tie-ins that aren't open-source and therefore can't be included in LineageOS' code.
This might or might  not affect you, depending on your personal usecase.
