{% include alerts/warning.html content="The following `virtio_*` build targets are not officially supported and are maintained by individual LineageOS maintainers. Due to this, unlike Cuttlefish/Emulator/AVD which is guaranteed to function when built, `virtio_*` build targets carry no such guarantee." %}
{% include alerts/warning.html content="None of the `virtio_*` build targets are built by LineageOS build servers, and no OTA updates will be delivered to builds of these targets. As such, you must build all images and update the builds manually." %}

## Known issues

Please note the following list of known issues with the `virtio_*` targets:

* Display color (only with Swiftshader graphics selected)
* Video playback (by default with Mesa graphics, which is the most common use case)

## Introduction

This is a good option if you want to use LineageOS without a physical device, test Generic System Images (GSIs), or experiment with low-level Android components.

{% include alerts/tip.html content="For Android application development and debugging, [Emulator/AVD](emulator.html) is a better choice." %}

These instructions will help you build a LineageOS image that is suitable to run in libvirt QEMU virtual machine.

{% include templates/device_build_before_init.md %}

### Initialize the LineageOS source repository

The following branches are currently supported for building image for libvirt QEMU virtual machine:

* lineage-21.0
* lineage-22.0
* lineage-22.1
* lineage-22.2

{% include snippets/branches.md %}
{% include templates/device_build_init_sync.md %}

## Select the target to build

Setup the environment:
```
source build/envsetup.sh
```

Virtual A/B partition scheme is used by default. If you would like to use non-A/B partition scheme instead (which requires less space), run the following command prior to each build:
```
export AB_OTA_UPDATER=false
```

To build one of the targets in the table below, run the following command:
```
breakfast <Target>
```

|      Target       |      Architecture     |    Type    |
|-------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| virtio_arm64      | ARM (32-bit + 64-bit) | PC         |
| virtio_arm64only  | ARM (64-bit only)     | PC         |
| virtio_x86_64     | x86 (64-bit only)     | PC         |
| virtio_x86_64_car | x86 (64-bit only)     | Automotive |
| virtio_x86_64_tv  | x86 (64-bit only)     | Android TV |
{: .table }

Alternatively, run these commands to build one of the sub-targets:
```
breakfast <Main target>
breakfast <Sub target>
```

|   Main target    |      Sub target      |           Architecture           |    Type    | Available since |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------|-----------------|
| virtio_arm64only | virtio_arm64only_16k | ARM (64-bit only, 16KB pagesize) | PC         | LineageOS 22.0  |
| virtio_arm64only | virtio_arm64only_go  | ARM (64-bit only)                | Android Go | LineageOS 21.0  |
| virtio_x86_64    | virtio_x86_64_go     | x86 (64-bit only)                | Android Go | LineageOS 21.0  |
{: .table }

{% include alerts/important.html content="Running one of the x86_64 targets require a CPU which supports SSE 4.2 instruction set, otherwise it will not boot. For LineageOS 22.1 and earlier, AVX instruction set is also required." %}

{% include alerts/important.html content="If you wish to run the virtual machine on ARMv9 devices (with hardware acceleration), you must select the `virtio_arm64only` target. The `virtio_arm64` target will not boot on these processor variants, as they don't support 32-bit mode." %}

{% include alerts/tip.html content="For ARMv8 devices, either `virtio_arm64` or `virtio_arm64only` would work (with hardware acceleration). The main difference is, the `virtio_arm64only` target does not support 32-bit only applications or tools." %}

## Start the build

Time to start building!

To build the installation image:
```
m espimage-install
```

If the build completed without errors, the installation image will appear at `out/target/product/<target>/lineage-*-{{ site.time | date: "%Y%m%d" }}-UNOFFICIAL-<target>.img`.

(Optional) Alternatively, you could also build installation image in ISO9660 format (only available for x86_64 targets):
```
m isoimage-install
```

If the build completed without errors, the installation image will appear at `out/target/product/<target>/lineage-*-{{ site.time | date: "%Y%m%d" }}-UNOFFICIAL-<target>.iso`.

Now, transfer the installation image to the device which you wish to run it on.

## Install the virtual machine software

On Debian / Ubuntu, installing the package `virt-manager` package will install the GUI manager and all necessary dependencies for the libvirt QEMU virtual machine.

Run the following command to install it:
```
sudo apt install virt-manager
```

Additionally, install the following packages according to your build's architecture:

| Android Architecture  |       Packages to install        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| ARM (32-bit + 64-bit) | qemu-system-arm qemu-efi-aarch64 |
| ARM (64-bit only)     | qemu-system-arm qemu-efi-aarch64 |
| x86 (64-bit only)     | qemu-system-x86 ovmf             |
{: .table }

5. Click `Apply`.

### Configure virtual machine sound

Sound card model `AC97` (which is the default) is recommended. Other models might work too but may have issues.

{% include alerts/important.html content="The `aarch64` architecture does not have a sound card added by default. You will have to add it manually." %}

### Create the new virtual machine
Click `Begin Installation` in the top left corner, the installation process will proceed, and then the virtual machine will start for the first time.

## Install LineageOS to the virtual machine

The virtual machine should boot into the boot manager menu of the installation image.

1. Select the first option, which is called something akin to `Install LineageOS` using arrow keys, and then press Enter.
2. The virtual machine should enter LineageOS Recovery. You can select options using the arrow keys and enter it by pressing Enter.
3. Select `Factory reset` > `Format data/factory reset` > `Format data`.
4. Select `Apply update` > `Choose INSTALL` > Select `lineage-*-{{ site.time | date: "%Y%m%d" }}-UNOFFICIAL-<target>.zip`.

Congratulations! You have installed LineageOS in a virtual machine.

You can now select `Reboot system now` to boot into LineageOS.

## Run LineageOS inside the virtual machine

The virtual machine should enter the LineageOS boot menu.

Select the first option (which should be automatically selected by default) to boot LineageOS.

## Run Generic System Images inside the virtual machine

{% include alerts/warning.html content="We do not guarantee that every GSIs will provide the same functionality level as the main OS." %}

Here we will utilize GSIs from the Android Open Source Project website as an example. There are three ways to run it:

### Dynamic System Updates

{% include alerts/tip.html content="This is the most convenient method." %}

{% include alerts/important.html content="Make sure the userdata disk is not too small. Minimum size of 8 GiB is recommended." %}

1. When booted into Launcher, open Settings app.
2. Enable `Developer options`, go back to homepage, and navigate to `System` > `Developer options`.
3. Open `DSU Loader`, select the DSU package that you wish to install, then click `Agree`.
4. Once the installation finishes, you can reboot to the GSI by clicking `Restart` on the `Dynamic System Updates` notification.

### Specify GSI image as the third VirtIO disk

1. Download a GSI image archive (equal or higher Android version with matching architecture) from [Generic System Image releases](https://developer.android.com/topic/generic-system-image/releases).
2. Extract `system.img` from the downloaded archive.
3. Add `system.img` as the third VirtIO disk.
4. Boot the virtual machine into recovery mode, and perform a factory reset.
5. Reboot to the boot menu, and select `Advanced options` > `Boot GSI from /dev/block/vdc with LineageOS * (Kernel version *)`.

### Flash GSI image to `system` logical partition

1. Download a GSI image archive (equal or higher Android version with matching architecture) from [Generic System Image releases](https://developer.android.com/topic/generic-system-image/releases).
2. Extract `system.img` from the downloaded archive.
3. Boot the virtual machine into recovery mode, and perform a factory reset.
4. Enter fastbootd mode by selecting `Advanced` > `Enter fastboot`.
5. Delete unneeded logical partitions, and flash the GSI image, using `fastboot`:
    ```
    fastboot -s tcp:<IPv4 address that shown on menu header> delete-logical-partition product
    fastboot -s tcp:<IPv4 address that shown on menu header> delete-logical-partition product_a
    fastboot -s tcp:<IPv4 address that shown on menu header> delete-logical-partition product_b
    fastboot -s tcp:<IPv4 address that shown on menu header> delete-logical-partition system_ext
    fastboot -s tcp:<IPv4 address that shown on menu header> delete-logical-partition system_ext_a
    fastboot -s tcp:<IPv4 address that shown on menu header> delete-logical-partition system_ext_b
    fastboot -s tcp:<IPv4 address that shown on menu header> flash system <path to GSI system.img>
    ```
6. Reboot to the boot menu, and proceed with the first option.

## Details for advanced users

### ADB connection

These targets offer ADB connectivity over Ethernet or VirtIO VSOCK.

To connect over Ethernet, run the following command:
```
adb connect <IPv4 address of the virtual machine>
```

To connect over VirtIO VSOCK, add `VirtIO VSOCK` virtual hardware before the virtual machine is started, and run the following command:
```
adb connect vsock:<Guest CID>:5555
```

### Fastbootd connection

These targets offer fastbootd connection through Ethernet.

Here's how to use fastbootd over Ethernet:
```
fastboot -s tcp:<IPv4 address that shown on menu header> [fastboot command...]
```

### GPU passthrough (for `virtio_x86_64` target)

Since LineageOS 22.1, the `virtio_x86_64` target supports direct display on a monitor connected to a real GPU via GPU passthrough in normal boot mode.

Currently, only Intel GPUs (iGPU or dGPU) are supported.

{% include alerts/note.html content="Neither the display color issue nor the video playback issue will likely occur on Intel GPUs." %}

{% include alerts/warning.html content="There is no guarantee that every GPU model will work fine without any problem. Initial testing used an Intel® HD Graphics 4600. If you have fixes for any GPU, feel free to submit!" %}

#### Additional build dependencies required for Intel Broadwell and later GPUs

* Install the package `python3-ply` with this command:`python3 -m pip install ply`.
* Provide Intel OpenCL C compiler executable at `prebuilts/intel-clc/intel_clc`.

#### Add GPU to the virtual machine

1. Enable VT-d (Intel) or IOMMU (AMD) in the host PC's BIOS settings.
2. Stop any driver from using the GPU on the host OS.
3. Probe `vfio-pci` kernel module with `ids` parameter containing PCI ID(s) of the GPU on the host OS.
4. Add PCI device of the GPU to the virtual machine at PCI bus `0x00` slot `0x1e`.

#### Start the virtual machine with GPU passthrough

When on the boot menu, enter the `Advanced options (virtio_x86_64 specific)` submenu, and select the option that corresponds to the GPU and/or your usecase.

If something that's related with graphics doesn't work in GPU passthrough mode, you could firstly try booting in SELinux Permissive mode by selecting `Settings` > `SELinux` > `Permissive` on boot menu before booting.

### Install flashable ZIPs in recovery mode

#### ADB sideload

ADB sideload (over Ethernet or VirtIO VSOCK) on these targets is supported since LineageOS 22.1.

To establish the connection, refer to [ADB connection](#adb-connection).

#### Export a directory as VirtioFS share

To add `Filesystem` virtual hardware, specify the directory containing the custom flashable ZIPs in the `Source path` box, and specify `share` in the `Target path` box.

When in recovery mode, enter `Apply update` > `Choose from virtiofs`, select the custom flashable ZIP which you want to install.

#### Insert a USB drive

Put the flashable ZIP into a USB drive, and mount the USB drive to the virtual machine.

When in recovery mode, select `Apply update`, and the volumes of the USB drive should appear on the menu. Select the corresponding volume, then select the custom flashable ZIP which you want to install.

### Text consoles

* The first serial console is used for interacting with the GRUB text menu and for printing kernel messages.
* The first VirtIO console is used for interacting with the Android shell environment.
* The second VirtIO console is used for printing Android logcat messages.
