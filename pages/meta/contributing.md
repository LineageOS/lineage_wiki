So, you've decided you want to edit the wiki. Awesome! This page will show you how to get started. Please follow the instructions that are most appropriate for you.

## LineageOS developer using `repo`

Adding the wiki to your local_manifests and running a local ruby based web server while modifying the content is the most convenient and familiar workflow. Please read more about [Contributing using repo](/contributing_via_repo.html).

## General contributor using `git`

People that aren't using the AOSP `repo` command will find it easier to work using `git` to control the flow. Please read more about [Contributing using git](/contributing_via_git.html).
