So, you've decided you want to help on the wiki. Awesome! This page will show you how to get started. Please follow the instructions that are most appropriate for you.

## LineageOS developer using `repo`

Running a local ruby based web server while modifying the content (which is already stored inside your LineageOS 14.1 source) is the most convenient and familiar workflow. Please read more about [Contributing using repo]({{ "contributing_using_repo.html" | relative_url }}).

## General contributor using `git`

People that aren't using the AOSP `repo` command will find it easier to work using `git` to control the flow. Please read more about [Contributing using git]({{ "contributing_using_git.html" | relative_url }}).
