## Getting set up

You will need to sync the repo, and this tutorial will guide you through installing `docker-ce` and `docker-compose`, and creating the
docker image. This will only need to be done once to get the environment setup. 

**Docker requires a 64 bit OS. If you do not have a 64 bit OS, do not continue**

### Install docker

```
# Add docker keyring
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

### Use docker without sudo

Add your user to the docker group in order to use docker commands without prefixing `sudo`:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

Now logout and log back in, or close and reopen your terminal

## Build the docker image

This builds the docker image, which should only need to be done once

```
cd $LINEAGE_SRC/lineage/wiki #Or to wherever you cloned the repository
docker build -t lineageos/wiki .
```

## Edit the wiki

Each time that you want to edit the wiki, you will need to start a local web server running Jekyll:

```
cd $LINEAGE_SRC/lineage/wiki/
docker run -p 4000:4000 -v $(pwd):/src lineageos/wiki --incremental
```

At this point you should be able to view the [local Jekyll server](http://127.0.0.1:4000).

{% include tip.html content="The incremental flag is automatically set in the image and will cause Jekyll to only reprocess each page as you change it (without the incremental flag, it would reprocess the entire site which takes 10-30+ seconds depending on your hardware). This works very well when editing meta pages but is a little annoying when editing the data/device/name.yml files. When editing those files you will need to save the data and then touch the `.md` file of the page that you are viewing in the browser. An easy way to do that is: `touch pages/*/<devicename>*`" %}
