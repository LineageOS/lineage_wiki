{% include important.html content="The following documentation does not consider some specific points of the i9100 and thus will not work!"%}

Points that this procedure does currently not consider:

* Booting a custom recovery requires to previously install a kernel which provides [Isolated Recovery](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s2/orig-development/isorec-isolated-recovery-galaxy-s2-t3291176) (IsoRec), like the one provided in LineageOS.
* TWRP, the custom recovery used in this documentation, [does not seem to work](https://github.com/TeamWin/Team-Win-Recovery-Project/issues/1002) with this device in its last version.
* The default partitions' sizes are not suitable for LineageOS.

If you can not wait for this procedure to be corrected:

1. Read it carefully to understand the general procedure.
2. Gather and follow instructions from the [following subreddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/LineageOS/comments/603qeq/cannot_boot_into_twrp_on_samsung_galaxy_s2/).
