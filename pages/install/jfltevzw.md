## Important note

{% include warning.html content="Warning: You must be on build I545VRUAMDK or this will not work. In fact, if you try to use this method on a newer revision, you will almost certainly brick your device. Seriously don't try it. Downgrading won't work either. If you've updated, a qfuse is already tripped and any attempt to downgrade will also result in a brick. You can check what build you are on in System Settings > More > About phone > Baseband Version." %}
