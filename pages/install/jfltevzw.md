## Important note

{% include warning.html content="Your device must be on bootloader version `I545VRUAMDK` or this will not work. In fact, if you try to use this method on a newer version, you will almost certainly brick your device. Seriously don't try it. Downgrading won't work either. If you've updated, rollback has been incremented higher than `VRUFMDK`, and due to the higher increment, downgrade attempts will result in a brick. You can check what bootloader your device is on by running the command `getprop ro.bootloader` in `adb shell` or a terminal app." %}
