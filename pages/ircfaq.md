## Can I get the experimental/migration build for my device?

Experimental migration builds were available for 2 months earlier on, they are since not available or supported. We suggest you make a backup, install a nightly by wiping, then restoring from backup.

## Where does the OTA updater store downloads?

In  /data/data/org.lineageos.updater/app_updates

## Why does TWRP fail verification of nightly zip during installation

TWRP does not have the signing keys used for nightly builds, install the zip without verification.

## How do I get the music app to see new files copied over to the device without a reboot?

Go to Settings - developer options - development tools - Media Provider - Scan SD Card
