### Developer relations managers

Developer relations managers are responsible for onboarding new contributors, reviewing incoming submissions, fielding public questions, and for keeping the health of the project.
Although everyone has a responsibility to help new people join the community, and to protect the project's health, these people maintain the contribution
pathways that connect to potential contributors to teams that have contribution opportunities and grant new device maintainers access to devices.
