## Generating the keys

{% include alerts/note.html content="You only need to run this once. If you ever rerun these, you'll need to
migrate between builds - see [Changing keys](#changing-keys)" %}

From the root of your Android tree, run these commands, altering the `subject` line to reflect your information:

```
subject='/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Android/OU=Android/CN=Android/emailAddress=android@android.com'
mkdir ~/.android-certs
for cert in bluetooth cyngn-app media networkstack nfc platform releasekey sdk_sandbox shared testcert testkey verity; do \
    ./development/tools/make_key ~/.android-certs/$cert "$subject"; \
done
```

{% capture apexapks %}

{% assign apexapks = apexapks | newline_to_br | strip_newlines | replace: "<br />", " " | strip | split: " " %}
{% assign apexes = apexes | newline_to_br | strip_newlines | replace: "<br />", " " | strip | split: " " %}

LineageOS 19.1 and above will also require APEXes be re-signed.
Each APEX file is signed with two keys: one for the mini file system image within an APEX and the other for the entire APEX.
In this case, only SHA256_RSA4096 keys are allowed, default is SHA256_RSA2048. So you need to make a copy of `./development/tools/make_key`
file and edit to use SHA256_RSA4096.
```
cp ./development/tools/make_key ~/.android-certs/
sed -i 's|2048|4096|g' ~/.android-certs/make_key
```
Then generate the APEX keys altering the `subject` line below to reflect your information.

{% include alerts/note.html content="Signing keys are usually password protected to ensure if they are accessed by unauthorized individuals they cannot be used to sign packages without knowledge of the password as well.  In this case to sign a LineageOS build, it requires you to setup a password file as described later on this page, which can be securely stored and retrieved as part of your build process.  Alternatively you can create the signing keys without a password by pressing enter when prompted by `make_key`, however this leaves your private keys unprotected if accessed by unauthorized individuals and you should take precautions to protect them and your build system from unauthorized access." %}

### Generate keys without a password
You will need to enter the blank passphrase twice for each APEX key generated.
```
for apex in {{ apexes | join: " " }}; do \
    subject='/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Android/OU=Android/CN='$apex'/emailAddress=android@android.com'; \
    ~/.android-certs/make_key ~/.android-certs/$apex "$subject"; \
    openssl pkcs8 -in ~/.android-certs/$apex.pk8 -inform DER -nocrypt -out ~/.android-certs/$apex.pem; \
done
```

You should keep these keys safe.

### Generate keys with a password
You will need to enter the passphrase twice for each APEX key generated.
```
for apex in {{ apexes | join: " " }}; do \
    subject='/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Android/OU=Android/CN='$apex'/emailAddress=android@android.com'; \
    ~/.android-certs/make_key ~/.android-certs/$apex "$subject"; \
    openssl pkcs8 -in ~/.android-certs/$apex.pk8 -inform DER -out ~/.android-certs/$apex.pem; \
done
```

You should keep these keys safe, and store the passphrase in a secure location.

## Generating an install package

{% include alerts/tip.html content="If you wish to preserve your data coming from a LineageOS build you
didn't build, see [Changing keys](#changing-keys)." %}

### Generating and signing target files

After following the build instructions for your device, instead of running `brunch <codename>`,
run the following:

```
breakfast <codename>
mka target-files-package otatools
```

Sit back and wait for a while - it may take a while depending on your computer's specs. After
it's finished, you just need to sign all the APKs and APEXes:

{% include alerts/note.html content="For LineageOS versions older than 18.1 you will have to prepend \"./build/tools/releasetools/\" on the \"sign_target_files_apks\" and \"ota_from_target_files\" commands below." %}

You may set `ANDROID_PW_FILE` and `EDITOR` environment variables for a more convenient way to enter certificate passwords. When you invoke the `sign_target_files_apks` command, the editor will open `ANDROID_PW_FILE` if this file is missing any relevant certificate passwords.
```
# Enter key passwords between the [[[ ]]] brackets
# (Additional spaces are harmless)

[[[    ]]] ~/.android-certs/bluetooth
[[[    ]]] ~/.android-certs/com.android.adbd
etc...
```
Populate the missing passwords, save the file, and close the editor. Make sure to store this file in a secure location.

Signing process for LineageOS versions 18.1 and below:
```
croot
sign_target_files_apks -o -d ~/.android-certs \
    $OUT/obj/PACKAGING/target_files_intermediates/*-target_files-*.zip \
    signed-target_files.zip
```
Signing process for LineageOS versions 19.1 and above:
```
croot
sign_target_files_apks -o -d ~/.android-certs \
    {%- for apexapk in apexapks %}
    --extra_apks {{ apexapk }}.apk=$HOME/.android-certs/releasekey \
    {%- endfor %}
    {%- for apex in apexes %}
    --extra_apks {{ apex }}.apex=$HOME/.android-certs/{{ apex }} \
    {%- endfor %}
    {%- for apex in apexes %}
    --extra_apex_payload_key {{ apex }}.apex=$HOME/.android-certs/{{ apex }}.pem \
    {%- endfor %}
    $OUT/obj/PACKAGING/target_files_intermediates/*-target_files*.zip \
    signed-target_files.zip
```

### Generating the install package

Now, to generate the installable zip, run:

```
ota_from_target_files -k ~/.android-certs/releasekey \
    --block --backup=true \
    signed-target_files.zip \
    signed-ota_update.zip
```

Then, install the zip in recovery as you normally would.

## Changing keys

### Using a migration build

{% include alerts/warning.html content="Builds with these patches are insecure - they reset the keys
on all packages at every boot. Install them for as little time as possible." %}

You can set up your own migration builds by running:

LineageOS 19.1:
```
repopick -f 327460
```

LineageOS 18.1:
```
repopick -f 297539
```

LineageOS 17.1:
```
repopick -f 266939
```

LineageOS 16.0:
```
repopick -f 239520
```

LineageOS 15.1:
```
repopick -f 192655 -P vendor/lineage
repopick -f 192656 -P frameworks/base
```

LineageOS 14.1:
```
repopick -f 156047 162144
```

Then, follow the [instructions to generate an install package](#generating-an-install-package).

#### Going back

After installing the migration build, you can switch back to building normal builds:

LineageOS 19.1:
```
cd frameworks/base
git reset --hard github/lineage-19.1
```

LineageOS 18.1:
```
cd frameworks/base
git reset --hard github/lineage-18.1
```

LineageOS 17.1:
```
cd frameworks/base
git reset --hard github/lineage-17.1
```

LineageOS 16.0:
```
cd frameworks/base
git reset --hard github/lineage-16.0
```

LineageOS 15.1:
```
cd vendor/lineage
git reset --hard github/lineage-15.1
croot
cd frameworks/base
git reset --hard github/lineage-15.1
```

LineageOS 14.1:
```
cd vendor/cm
git reset --hard github/cm-14.1
croot
cd frameworks/base
git reset --hard github/cm-14.1
```

### Using a script

You can also use a script or small flashable zip designed to be run once, before installing
a build with the new keys. The script is available under
`./lineage/scripts/key-migration/migration.sh`

The script can also be made into a zip, by inserting it into a zip similar to
[this](https://blunden.se/migration). This zip has the script placed in
`META-INF/com/google/android/update-binary` with some additions to print status messages to
the recovery.

#### Test-keys to official or vice versa

If you are moving from a test-keys build (e.g. an "unsigned" unofficial build) to an official
LineageOS build, you can push the script to your device and run it from Android:

```
adb root # This requires an userdebug/eng build and ADB root access to be enabled
adb shell stop
adb push ./lineage/scripts/key-migration/migration.sh /data/local/tmp/migration.sh
adb shell sh /data/local/tmp/migration.sh official
adb reboot recovery
# Now install the official LineageOS install zip
```

Or run it from recovery:

```
# Ensure both /data and /system are mounted, then continue
adb push ./lineage/scripts/key-migration/migration.sh /data/local/tmp/migration.sh
adb shell sh /data/local/tmp/migration.sh official
```

If you are migrating from an official build to your own "unsigned" builds, you can run the
script in the same way, but instead using the argument "unofficial" instead of "official".

#### Test-keys to your own release-keys or vice versa

If you are moving from test-keys to your own signed builds, you can add your own keys to the
script. First, export your keys to the required format, by running the script in
`./lineage/scripts/key-migration/export-keys.sh`.

{% include alerts/note.html content="You may need to modify this script to change the location of
your certificate directory if you are not using the default certificate directory." %}

This will print the keys and certs to the terminal in the format required. Next, edit the
script to use your keys. You will need to comment out (by prepending a `#`), or remove the
existing definitions of the "release" keys and certs. Now, copy and paste your output from
above into the script where the previous lines were. Make sure to leave the "test" keys and
certs definitions untouched.

Your script is ready to go! Push it to the device and run it, in the same way as described
above, then install your own signed zip. If you ever need to run this in reverse, simply
use the "unofficial" argument instead of "official", and your keys will be replaced with
the official keys.
